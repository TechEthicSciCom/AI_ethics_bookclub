# AICN AI Ethics Bookclub

Welcome to the [Artificial Intelligence Collaborative Network](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/) AI Ethics Bookclub.

We are a group of statisticians, lawyers, data scientists, sociologists, programmers and policy workers. We meet on the third Monday of each month disscuss a book that investigates the intersections of:
* data
* justice
* statistics
* politics
* artificial inteligence
* ethics

Out meet-ups are online from 6pm to 7:30pm [Adelaide](https://time.is/Adelaide), South Australia time.

Read below to see the books we've read, are reading and will read. We also have a list (that grows faster than we can get though it) of books that we'd like to read in the future. 

If you'd like to join, feel free to contact [Owen Churches](https://twitter.com/OwenChurches) for more information or join the [AICN](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/contact) Slack Workspace and find your way to the #ethics-bookclub channel. Its important to register through the channel because we have a [code of conduct](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/code-of-conduct) that we hold ourselves accountable to.
