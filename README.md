# AICN AI Ethics Bookclub

Welcome to the [Artificial Intelligence Collaborative Network](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/) AI Ethics Bookclub.

We are a group of statisticians, lawyers, data scientists, sociologists, programmers, tech workers, policy workers and others. We meet online on the third Monday of each month at from 6pm to 7:30pm [Adelaide](https://time.is/Adelaide), South Australia time to disscuss a book that investigates the intersections of: data, justice, statistics, politics, artificial inteligence and ethics.

Read below to see the books we've read, are reading and will read. We also have a [list](future_reading.md#future-reading-list) (that grows faster than we can get though it) of books that we'd like to read in the future. 

If you'd like to join, feel free to contact [Owen Churches](https://twitter.com/OwenChurches) for more information or join the [AICN](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/contact) Slack Workspace yourself and find your way to the #ethics-bookclub channel. Its important to register through the channel because we have a [code of conduct](https://www.collaborativenetwork.ai/code-of-conduct) that we hold ourselves accountable to.
